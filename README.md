# Acala-Challenge
Acala's scheduller challenge

Implementation of a time delaying multi-sig admin contract using the schedular feature of Acala EVM
The multi-signature contract administrates an upgradable contract. The upgradable contract is implemented using the Transparent Proxy approach.

## Dependecies

All the requiered dependecies are listed in the packege.json file. I strongly recommed to usea the exact dependencies versions listed in the packege.json file, since there are 
compatibilty issues in subsequent versions
